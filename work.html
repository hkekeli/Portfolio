                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <i>This paper explores digital African storytelling techniques using human factor principles. I reference Miller’s law and the Law of Uniform Connectedness to explore how these principles may build on each other to create compelling stories and document use cases where they fall short.</i>

                    <h3>Background</h3>

                    <p>Many African societies have long and established storytelling traditions. Recreating those stories on the web is a daunting task, but one many Africans are undertaking on social media. In 2019, I started TogoArchives, a social media account to document Togolese history. The idea was inspired by a similar blog on the history of the Congo, and it features articles covering the history of Togolese people from the pre-colonial era to the post-colonial era. After three years of doing this research, I have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of this work and have grown familiar with the challenges that come with it. One of the primary challenges of this work involves repurposing stories written about Africans to a western audience and retelling those stories to an audience they were never meant for. Although the title of this article mentions African stories, what I’d like to do is tell a larger story about leveraging human-centered principles to design stronger and more nuanced narratives on the web.
                    Every day, more and more Africans are documenting their countries’ history on social media. A quick search on Instagram reveals multiple archival accounts, in various languages, with strong audience participation. The comments under the posts often surface a regular theme: “Why don’t they teach this in schools?”  Some projects like archives.ivoires focus on specific countries. Others like Sunu Journal are more ambitious, covering aspects of past and contemporary African life across the continent. Others, go more depth, tracing the history of a people throughout history. Sharing these narratives on social media platforms comes with its challenges: namely, the ability to command readers’ attention while other stories equally compete for their attention.
                    Telling compelling non-linear narratives in bite-size form
                    In 2013, Josh Schwartz, a data scientist at the traffic analysis firm Chartbeat conducted an analysis of reading patterns at Slate and found that readers rarely make it down to the end of the page when they land on a story. Schwartz’s data suggested that many people tweet out links to articles they haven’t fully read. However, when it came to video and photo content, most visitors see all the content.
                    Fig 1: Schwartz’s data shows that many visitors do not scroll.</p>

                   <p> Similar studies conducted by Statista in 2019 reveal that viewing photos and videos are a primary need amongst users. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok don’t face this problem since they primarily focus on visual media content. For this reason, content providers can focus more on non-linear forms of storytelling, which is where we can leverage Miller’s law and the Law of Uniform Connectedness.
                    Using Human factor principles in non-linear narratives
                    According to Miller’s law, the average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory. In Designing with the Mind in Mind, Jeff Johnson defines working memory as the “combined focus of our attention: everything that we are conscious of at a given time.” (107) One way to alleviate this constraint is to organize content in smaller chunks to help users process, understand and memorize quickly. Miller’s law works well for scenarios where the goal is to teach or convey information. On social media, where multiple stories compete for readers' attention, content providers can apply Miller’s law by sharing shorter stories that are still impactful. The stories can be short captions or multiple posts of the same story broken up into smaller parts.
                    Miller’s law also works well with non-linear narratives. A non-linear narrative is a storytelling technique in which elements of the story are presented in non-chronological order. In “Building non-linear narratives for the web,” Senongo Akpem defines non-linear narratives as a collection of related content blocks organized around a story. He argues that the web conflicts with the traditional storytelling arc and has allowed for non-linear narratives that give designers the flexibility to tell more compelling and uninterrupted narrative flows.
                    While Miller’s law informs how readers interact with a story, the Law of Uniform Connectedness helps facilitate comprehension and encourages readers to stick around. Both principles supplement each other as one is based on the process of acquiring knowledge, while the other is based on perception. Miller’s Law doesn’t work well with long-form content or technical stories requiring domain knowledge or training. In those cases, the Law of Uniform Connectedness might work better to provide context and reinforce learning. Conversely, the Law of Uniform Connectedness doesn’t work when the content is primarily text-based.

                    Techniques and application of human-centered principles to non-linear narratives

                    When sharing impactful narratives, it’s important to focus on the user experience. Consider the questions outlined below.
                    What’s your content strategy?

                    Content strategy is an integral part of successful storytelling. The Law of Uniform Connectedness works well here. Here are some two tips on applying these principles to storytelling.
                    Use relevant imagery
                    Allow readers to map story elements to the actors identified in the story. In “Early Exploration of the stars”, Google’s tribute to the Mali Empire shares the story of Mali emperor Mansa Abubakari II, who assembled two fleets of two hundred ships for an expedition into the Atlantic as early as 1310, before Christopher Columbus. Though the story starts with the emperor’s accomplishments, it leads with an imagery of Christopher Columbus. The presentation of the story missed an opportunity to center on the main character, opting instead to lead with a supporting character.

                    Fig 2. In “Early Exploration of the Earth and Star,” the story leads with an image of Christopher Columbus

                    Create connected stories. According to the law of uniform connectedness, elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than other elements with no connection. You can use uniform connectedness to show context or to emphasize the relationship between similar items. To apply this principle to non-linear narratives, group elements of a similar nature so they are visually or thematically connected. Images can be color-coded or include visual elements like arrows, lines, or color to communicate relationships.
                    Who are you writing for?
                    Defining your audience and understanding their needs is key to telling the right story to the right audience. When asked if his films were understood in Europe, Ousmane Sembène, a Senegalese film director replied: “Europe is not my center.” Similarly, when writing narratives about Africans to Africans, content providers should understand their audience's needs, and publish materials fit for that audience. While sharing these stories, ask the following questions:
                    What are the tradeoffs?
                    What accommodations will you make for those reading your story?
                    What might get lost in translation?
                    Who are you writing about?
                    Center your characters and write from their point of view. Considering their goals, their needs, and the constraints they faced, helps you understand them and convey that information to your audience.
                    The takeaways
                    A story well told, to the right audience, is inspiring and empowering. In this paper, I propose ways to publish better visual narratives on the web and explore the constraints that come with sharing those narratives. I discuss Miller’s law and the Law of Uniform Connectedness and argue that both principles work best when sharing narratives in a competitive space.
